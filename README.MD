Each project has integration tests that check the same specifications as the FreeCodeCamp tests. In this way the projects can be tested in local. The tests are implemented with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) and [Chai HTTP](https://www.chaijs.com/plugins/chai-http/).
